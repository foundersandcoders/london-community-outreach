# Proposal: Re-thinking Coding for Everyone
This [proposal](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/london-programme/issues/149) was passed at the 4th March 2017 business meeting.

#### Aside: Why does it need re-thinking?

There is little clarity on what our meetups are designed to achieve. They are fairly structure-less and current cohort members don't receive any guidance on how to run the evenings. As a result, our meetups generally don't seem to offer the best possible experience for attendees.

## Why (this version of C4E)?
Following directly from the mission of the organisation, our meetups should help us:
+ Open access to education
  + Be aimed at _anyone_ wanting to learn to code, not just FAC applicants (not what I was saying before the AGM)
+ Build democratically-organised learning communities
  + Attendees should feel welcomed from the minute they arrive
  + Pairing should be strongly encouraged and resources should be chosen to facilitate this
  + The style should remain peer-led, as this is an introduction to what FAC is all about. Peer-led + structure is possible - this is what our curriculum is based on
  + Encourage anyone who wants more meetups to set up their own on the self-organising meetup group and/or tell them about other existing meetups that they could join. This is especially important for those who outgrow a meetup that is designed to be accessible for complete beginners
+ Free at the point of access
  + Still run by the current cohort as part of the course, to ensure the sustainable longevity of these free meetups
  + FAC does not have its own equipment...yet (see the "Equipment section of https://github.com/foundersandcoders/tasks/issues/2#issuecomment-269776672), but should try to find funding for this. In the meantime, attendees must be warned that laptops aren't provided, _but strongly encouraged to attend as they may be able to pair with someone who has one_. We should try to source laptops so that beginners aren't required to have their own

To be considered fringe benefits:
+ Increase exposure for the bootcamp
+ Offer everyone a chance to ask questions about the course, and get a feel for who we are and what we are about before applying/being accepted

## What?

_One_ meetup on Mondays on meetup.com, with distinct categories specified on meetup.com:
+ Free Code Camp - not great for pairing, but unavoidable until we can find more collaborative resources for _total_ beginners
  + Those who aren't complete beginners should be encouraged to try the other topics. Even those with relatively little experience of JS will get more out of the following collaborative resources
+ Eloquent Javascript
+ Codewars

Potential extras  in the specific instances when participants feel the need to be stretched beyond the above offerings:
+ CS50

## How?
### Advertising of meetups
+ _One_ meetup on Mondays on meetup.com, with the categories specified in the contents
  + Reduces confusion over how the event is run - it is really only one event
  + Avoids disappointment when someone turns up "for the Eloquent Javascript event" and no one else who has arrived has chosen to do that
+ Transparency about the peer-led nature of how these meetups are run - in the contents of meetup.com & highlighted and explained by mentors at the start
+ Specify that laptops aren't provided, but we encourage pairing so people are welcome to show up without a laptop in the hope that they can find a partner who has one

### Running the event
Organisers must be at the door, registering attendees as they come in & sending them to the appropriate area of the room for their topic.

#### Advice sheet
Community Outreach Committee to draft "How to run our meetups" advice sheet, to be given to the current cohort as guidance on how to host our meetups. (My original ideas were included in my original "proposal" and can still be seen in the comments below - these remain nothing more than ideas until I can raise this at the Community Outreach Committee)

#### Registering attendees
Community Outreach Committee to draw up spreadsheet for registering attendees. Recording various metrics can be used to measure how well these meetups are achieving their aims (above).

Stats:
+ how many people sign up on meetup.com vs how many show up
+ retention rate over time e.g. how many return for their 2nd time, how many return each week, etc.
+ keep track of who our regular participants are, consider reaching out to them if new meetups arise
+ send out automatic "thanks for coming" email containing useful links
