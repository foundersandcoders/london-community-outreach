## Relationship between Founders & Coders and Weekend Coders

The proposal was raised in [a `london-programme` issue](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/london-programme/issues/205) and passed on 02/05/2017 - see the [minutes](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/london-programme/blob/add-old-minutes/minutes/02-05-2017.md#relationship-between-founders--coders-and-weekend-coders-205---passed).

### WHY

FAC alums @sohilpandya @tormod17 @RachBLondon are building a separate business called Weekend Coders that offers paid coding workshops. Under a previous arrangement, this team advertised the workshop on FAC channels as a FAC workshop and used the FAC space to host the events.

See: https://www.meetup.com/founderscoders/events/236232922/

In this ad, for example, the workshop is called “HTML & CSS” and it is not clear that a separate group (Weekend Coders) is hosting the event.

In the past, participants paid between £40-£100 to attend, and Weekend Coders donated 10-30% of the proceeds go back to FAC, depending on attendance.

Based on the success of these workshops, the Weekend Coders team is planning several more this spring and summer. Before they proceed with planning, they want to clarify the relationship between Founders & Coders and Weekend Coders.

### WHAT

Founders & Coders will rent space to Weekend Coders for a nominal fee, such as £100 for the day. If Weekend Coders would like to donate more to Founders & Coders they can choose to make a separate charitable contribution.

Weekend Coders will continue to use the Founders & Coders meetup channel, Gitter channel, and Facebook page for advertising, but will make clear that the workshops being hosted by a separate group.

A sample Meetup event might read: “HTML & CSS workshop by our friends the Weekend Coders.” The event details can specify the fee for attendance and explain that Weekend Coders are a group of Founders & Coders alums building a separate business. Weekend Coders should also post its own logo as part of the meetup event.

When advertised outside of FAC channels, the event could read, “Weekend Coders: HTML & CSS workshop” with the location specified in the event details.

### HOW

If passed, Weekend Coders can sign a simple MOU with FAC specifying the terms of the space rental. Afterwards, they can immediately begin advertising for their next workshop using the suggested format.  

Weekend Coders will transition to its own Meetup.com channel within six months. Founders & Coders will continue to promote the opportunity on other channels such as Facebook and Gitter.
